Web-Based Per Diem Request Management System
           
            
Proposed Project Description

1. Problem Diagnosis
1.1 Problem Domain:
The management of per diem requests within organizations involves handling daily allowances for employees’ travel-related expenses. Currently, many organizations rely on manual, paper-based systems or informal communication channels like emails. These methods are inefficient, especially as organizations grow, leading to delays, errors, and frustration for employees and management.
1.2	 Specific Issues in Current Practices
1.	Manual Processes and Paperwork:
o	Employees submit requests via paper forms or emails, leading to delays and errors.
o	Example: A misplaced form delays reimbursement, causing employee frustration.
2.	Lack of Real-Time Tracking and Reporting:
o	No centralized system exists to track requests, leading to lost or duplicate submissions.
o	Example: An employee cannot check the status of their request, causing confusion.
3.	Approval Delays and Confusion:
o	Approvals depend on physical signatures or emails, which are slow and unreliable.
o	Example: A manager on vacation delays an employee’s travel plans.
4.	Difficulty in Policy Adherence and Fraud Prevention:
o	Manual systems cannot enforce per diem policies, leading to overpayments or fraud.
o	Example: An employee accidentally submits a request exceeding the daily limit, and it goes unnoticed.
1.3 Research Insights: 
•	Observation: Employees often follow up repeatedly to ensure requests are processed.
•	Interviews: 70% of employees find the current process time-consuming, while managers struggle with transparency.

1.4 Sub-Issues to Address:
To tackle the issues outlined above, the following sub-issues need to be addressed:
•	Streamlining the Submission Process: By transitioning to a web-based system, the submission of per diem requests will be faster and more efficient. Employees will be able to submit requests digitally, reducing reliance on paperwork and manual processes.
•	Centralized Tracking and Real-Time Updates: The proposed system will allow both employees and managers to track the status of requests, budgets, and approvals in real-time. This centralization will provide better transparency and reduce the risk of lost requests or confusion.
•	Faster Approval Workflow: With digital approval workflows, managers can review and approve requests at their convenience, speeding up the approval process and reducing delays.
•	Ensuring Policy Adherence: The system will include built-in validation rules to ensure that per diem requests adhere to organizational policies (e.g., maximum daily rates), preventing errors or fraudulent requests from being approved.

.2. Proposed Treatment
2.1 Overview of the Proposed Solution
The Web-Based Per Diem Request Management System will automate and streamline the submission, approval, and tracking of per diem requests. It will replace manual processes with an online platform, improving efficiency, reducing errors, and ensuring transparency.
Interventions to Address Identified Problems
1.	Automated Submission of Per Diem Requests:
o	Employees submit requests via an online form with pre-filled per diem rates.
o	Benefit: Reduces errors and saves time.
2.	Centralized Tracking and Approval Workflow:
o	Managers review requests via a dashboard with automatic notifications.
o	Benefit: Improves visibility and reduces delays.
3.	Reporting and Analytics:
o	Real-time reports on per diem usage and budget tracking.
o	Benefit: Enhances financial decision-making and transparency.
2.2 Metrics for Success:
The success of the proposed Web-Based Per Diem Request Management System will be measured through several key metrics:
1.	Reduction in Time Spent on Request Processing: By automating the submission and approval process, we expect a significant reduction in the time it takes for an employee to submit a request and receive approval. This can be measured by comparing the time it currently takes to process requests manually versus using the new system.
2.	Improved Accuracy and Fewer Errors: The number of errors in per diem requests, such as incorrect amounts or missing information, should decrease dramatically. Success can be measured by tracking error rates before and after implementing the system.
3.	Increased Employee and Manager Satisfaction: Surveys can be used to gauge employee and manager satisfaction with the new system. We anticipate higher satisfaction due to faster processing times and fewer bottlenecks in approvals.
2.3 Illustrative Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Employee Submitting a Request
Chaltu, an employee planning a business trip to a conference, logs into the system and fills out the online per diem request form. She selects the dates, destination, and expenses. After submitting the request, Chaltu receives an immediate confirmation. The system then alerts her manager, Bulcha, who can approve or reject the request with a single click.
Benefit: Chaltu avoids paperwork, and Bulcha avoids having to manually review multiple email chains or forms. The approval process is faster and more efficient for both.
Scenario 2: Manager Reviewing Requests
Bulcha receives an email notification that a new per diem request from Chaltu is awaiting his approval. He logs into the system, views the details, and sees that the request is within the allowed budget. He approves it with a click.
Benefit: Bulcha no longer needs to track down paper forms or deal with confusing email threads. The system provides all the necessary information in a clear, accessible way.
Scenario 3: Generating a Report for Auditing
At the end of the month, finance manager Biiftuu needs to prepare a report for an internal audit. She logs into the system and runs a report showing all per diem requests for the past month. Benefit: Biiftuu no longer spends hours compiling data manually; the system does it in minutes, providing accurate and comprehensive reports for auditing.


2.4 Expected Improvements Over Current Practices:
•	Faster Processing: With automated request submission and approval workflows, the processing time for per diem requests will be reduced by up to 50%.
•	Increased Transparency: Both employees and managers will have a clear view of request statuses and budgets at all times.
•	Improved Compliance: Automated checks will help ensure that per diem requests comply with organizational policies, reducing the risk of overpayments and fraud.
•	Better Budget Tracking: The ability to generate real-time reports will enhance the organization’s ability to track spending and forecast future needs more accurately.
